Goal: Place a queen somewhere such that no queen are attacking each other
Approach: backtracking
- each recursive layer will decide on a row and also the placement of the queen
- the constraint is making sure we do not place a queen where its in sight of another queen. How?
    1) make sure it is not on the same column --> create a column set
    2) make sure it is not in same diagonal path --> create a diagonal set (calculated via r+c)
    3) make sure it is not in a antidiagonal path --> create a antidiagonal set (calculated via r-c)
    
    We dont need to worry about rows because it is handled by the backtracking parameter that always recurse
    to next level of the row
    
    ** note: if you dont know why r+c and r-c are diagonal paths --> Draw it out and check why it does!!
